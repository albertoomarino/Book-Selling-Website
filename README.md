## Introduction

The Web Technologies project was useful for learning the basics of web development. As mentioned above, different programming languages and markup were used to gain knowledge of how to work in the network environment.

## Files

The repository consists of two folders:
- Folder **lab**: contains six laboratory exercises with the various deliverables and implementations;
- Folder **project**: contains the code of the actual website, the requirements provided by the professor, and the report describing the entire project in full.

## Installation

To install the following project, you must have installed a software application on your machine that provides a local development environment for creating and testing websites and web applications (I used **XAMPP**).

To clone the repository locally, simply run in your *Git Bash* the command `git clone https://github.com/albertoomarino/web-technologies.git`.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project and launched it, you need to create a database called `getbook`. At this point, from the XAMPP web interface, you can import the complete database in the `getbook.sql` file into the `database` folder.

After registering to the site rather than logging in, it is possible to navigate within the platform to view all implemented functions. For more details on navigation and implementation, please refer to the `Report.pdf`.
