# TWeb - Web Technologies

The theme of the site is free and chosen by the student. However, the site must be structured in such a way as to follow the given specifications. An important part of the realization of the site is the accompanying report that technically describes how the various functions were implemented, the structure of the back end, the structure of the front end, and how communication between the various levels of the architecture was handled.

The student will be able to use all the technologies seen during the course: HTML(5), CSS(3), PHP5 (web connection, web service), JavaScript (JS Events, DOM), JS libraries (Ajax, data exchange (XML or JSON), web service, etc.), and the use of the following technologies. The problems that have been analyzed and for which solutions have been discussed (presentation/content/separation behavior, web security, etc.) will have to be addressed: the aim of the final work is to enable the connection of all the topics covered with the aim of creating a professional website.

Tools that we did not have the opportunity to explore during the course, such as: Bootstrap, PHP Object Oriented, PHP 7.4, MVC pattern, Angular.js, etc. However, it must be considered that these technologies will only be assessed as **optional** and not compulsory and **complementary** to the use of the basic technologies, which one must in any case demonstrate the ability to master even without using more or less advanced frameworks.

## Introduction

The Web Technologies project was useful for learning the basics of web development. As mentioned above, different programming languages and markup were used to gain knowledge of how to work in the network environment.

## Characteristics

The repository consists of two folders:
- Folder **lab**: contains six laboratory exercises with the various deliverables and implementations;
- Folder **project**: contains the code of the actual website, the requirements provided by the professor, and the report describing the entire project in full.

## Installation

To install the following project, you must have installed a software application on your machine that provides a local development environment for creating and testing websites and web applications (I used **XAMPP**).

To clone the repository locally, simply run in your *Git Bash* the command `git clone https://github.com/albertoomarino/TWeb.git`.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project and launched it, you need to create a database called `getbook`. At this point, from the XAMPP web interface, you can import the complete database in the `getbook.sql` file into the `database` folder.

After registering to the site rather than logging in, it is possible to navigate within the platform to view all implemented functions. For more details on navigation and implementation, please refer to the `Report.pdf`.
