# TWEB - Web Technologies
Laboratory of Web Technologies, Computer Science Course - A.Y. 2022/2023  
Department of Computer Science, University of Turin  
Teacher: Marco Botta

## Lab project
The **theme of the site is free and chosen by the student**. Nonetheless, the site must be structured in such a way as to follow the specifications indicated. An important part of the creation of the site is the accompanying report which technically describes the way in which the various functions have been implemented , the structure of the back end, the structure of the front end and the way in which the communication was managed between the various levels of architecture.

The student will be able to use **all the technologies seen during the course:** HTML(5), CSS(3), PHP5 (web connection, web service), JavaScript (JS Events, DOM), JS libraries (Ajax, data exchange (XML or JSON) , web services, etc. The problems that have been analyzed and for which solutions have been discussed (separation presentation/content/behavior, web security, etc.) will need to be addressed: the aim of the final work is to allow the connection of all the topics discussed with the aim of creating a professional website.

Tools that we did not get to explore during the course will also be considered eligible, such as: Bootstrap, PHP Object Oriented, PHP 7.4, MVC patterns, Angular.js, etc. However, it should be considered that these technologies will only be evaluated as **optional** and not mandatory and **complementary** to the use of the basic technologies, which must in any case be demonstrated to be able to master even without resorting to more or less advanced frameworks.

The files in the repository have been uploaded as follows:
* **TestoProgetto.pdf**: pdf file showing the delivery of the project developed by the professors
